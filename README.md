# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose of this challenge:
Using our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

Here are the images of our overlay and webiste:

In delivarable 2  we are using our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, to add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). we also added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer- as this part of the code uses the recent 7 days data - it does not show any dots as there was no earthquake over magnitude 4.5 in last 7 days. The code is working ok here.
