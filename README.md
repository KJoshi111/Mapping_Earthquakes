# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Purpose of this challenge:
In this project, we utilized our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to add tectonic plate data using d3.json() and the data using the geoJSON() layer. We also set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

Here are the images of our overlay and webiste:

In Deliverable 2, we used our knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, to add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). We also added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake. We added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer. As this part of the code uses only data from the last seven days, it does not show any dots as there were no earthquakes over the magnitude of 4.5 in last 7 days. The code is working fine here.
